Self-Balancing Two-Wheeled Robot by WorkerCraftsman on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4593553

Summary:
This design is a Self-Balancing Robot that I created for fun. Details on how to make this project can be found in the README file under the files folder (Not the text file that is generated with the ZIP file).There are probably some instructions that could be clarified more so just comment here or on the eventual Youtube video and I'll help out and add information to the instructions as well.Video: https://youtu.be/2k_8KneGMak
